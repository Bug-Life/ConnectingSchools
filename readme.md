Connecting Schools was a project assigned as a part of the course curriculum at The LNMIIT, Jaipur.

Course name - Software Engineering.

It is a very basic functional website and my very first try at web development. It is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP as server side scripting language and MONGO DB as a non relational database.

Event management and oreventing clashes is the basic aim of ConnectingSchools. 

The website is not built using any web development framework.
